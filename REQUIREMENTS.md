# 443 - An empty repo for the course project

This repo should be used for submitting your course project. Refer to the project assignment document for more details about the project. 

## Objectives:  

- To build a medium-scale Java program using OOP concepts 
- To work in teams and learn from each other 


## Description: 

In this project, each team will build a Java program by going through the following design processes: 

Expressing object orientation through exploring classes, interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, exception handling, and collection. 

Implementing and debugging an object-oriented program and enhancing it if there is a need. 

Documenting the program through Javadoc tool in IDE 

 

## General Rules and Policies: 

Form a group of up to 6 students per project. The size of the group must be approved by the instructor.  

Each group must assign a leader who will be responsible for submitting the work on behalf of the whole group and to be always in touch with the instructor through the trimester 

Each group must have a GitHub repo for their project 

Each partner is supposed to contribute equally on the project, meaning she should be significantly contributing ideas alongside with other partners, coding, taking turn typing all required documents and presenting the project 

Instructor will set up an electronic form and share the link on Blackboard, and each leader has to submit his/her group responses.  Ideas will be assigned to groups based on first come first served!  

ONLY upon instructor approval, a group may suggest an idea of their taste and has to be none of the listed topics below. 


# Project Requirements: 

Each group must apply concepts learned in class in their project, such as: 

- Classes and objects (required) 

- Polymorphism (optional) 

- Inheritance (required) 

- Encapsulation (required) 

- Abstraction or Interfaces (optional) 

- Exception handling (required) 

- Collections / Arrays (required) 

- Files (required) 

 
## Grading Criteria:  

Projects will be graded out of 100 points; however, it is actually worth 20% of the final grade 

These points are broken according to 5 deliverable parts:  

### Part 1: 5 points 
For project description and team formation

### Part 2: 40 points 

Creating Java classes and applying OOP concepts, such as: inheritance, polymorphism, method overriding and overloading, abstract classes, interfaces, exception handling and collections  

### Part 3: 20 points 

Providing a prototype as follows:  

10 points for developing a functional program that has a main class where a set of tasks are being tested. Each group needs to show a proof that at least some of the tasks are working and producing reasonable outcome from their system, such as prints out information on the screen.  

10 points for providing a well written javadoc  

### Part 4: 30 points for: 

The final implementation and delivery of working software. The deliverable program should have no compilation or run-time errors. Also, the results or the outputs of the program must be logical and reasonable. The implementation should have a complete well-written Javadoc (20 points).  

Submitting a design document -10 points - that includes the following: 

One paragraph describing all implemented methods in the project 

One paragraph about how to use the program (should act as a user manual) 

One paragraph listing all team members and their contributions on the project 

One paragraph describes any other concepts that are self-taught and behind the learning objectives of this course, such as GUI   

### Part 5: 5 points 
Presenting the final project to the whole class  
 

## Submission Details: 

The leader of the group is responsible for submitting the project on GitHub 

Project repo must include a Readme file that specifies (*you can replace this file*):  

- The name of the project 

- Group members (Names and IDs)

- Project description
